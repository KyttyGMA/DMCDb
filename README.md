# Dual Memory Contextual Database (DMCDB)

## Description
The **Dual Memory Contextual Database (DMCDB)** project is an experimental database designed to optimize data access through a primary and secondary memory structure. It uses an innovative approach based on a **one-dimensional topological space** that folds onto itself, allowing access to different "layers" of data according to the context of the request.

## Key Features
- **Dual Memory**: Data is stored in two levels of memory, primary (RAM) and secondary (disk).
- **Contextual Access**: Depending on the type of query, different layers of information are accessed.
- **Resource Optimization**: By folding the data space, the use of primary memory is minimized and access to relevant information is optimized.
- **Caching System**: Frequently queried data is stored in primary memory for fast access.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Go (or the language of your choice)
- **Storage System**: Redis for primary memory and Cassandra for persistent storage (optional).
- **Access Algorithms**: Topological space folding algorithm for contextual access.

## Installation
